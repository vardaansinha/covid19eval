    <p>During these extraordinary times, mental health is a very important factor in our lives that we need to keep track of. Yes, we need to mainly stay inside, but that shouldn't stop you from getting a healthy amount of fresh air in your yard, or even a short walk with a mask on in your community. Additionally, it is important for us to regularly evaluate our mental health. How do you do that? Well, with the MH Evaluation Quiz, specifically designed for the COVID-19 pandemic, you can easily find out how you are doing, and what you can do to improve your frame of mind.</p>
